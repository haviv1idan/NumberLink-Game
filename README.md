Hi 

About the game:
Consider an n × n array of squares.
Some of the squares are empty, some are solid, and some non-solid squares are marked by integers 1, 2, 3, … 
Each integer occupies exactly two different squares on the board. 
The task of the player is to connect the two occurrences of each integer on the board 
by a simple path using horizontal and vertical movements alone. 
No two different paths are allowed to intersect one another. 
No path may include any solid square (solid squares are forbidden to appear on any path). 
Finally, all non-solid squares must be filled by the paths.

How to play:
1. Click with the mouse on the number that you want to connect
2. After than you clicked start move with the arrows
